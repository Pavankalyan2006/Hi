To analyze the inputs and outputs of the model, we need to break down the features (inputs) and the target variable (output). Let's go through each step:

1. Inputs (Features):
The input data to the LSTM model consists of several features that describe the characteristics of an earthquake:

time_num: This is the time converted into numeric form, representing the number of days since the first earthquake event in the dataset. This feature captures the temporal progression of earthquakes.

latitude: This represents the geographic location of the earthquake in terms of its latitude. Latitude is important because earthquakes are geographically distributed, and their occurrence might depend on proximity to tectonic plate boundaries.

longitude: This is the geographic location of the earthquake in terms of its longitude. Along with latitude, longitude provides the spatial position of an earthquake on the Earth’s surface.

magnitudo (Magnitude): This is the strength of the earthquake, and it’s typically a measure of the energy released during the earthquake. This is the target value that we want to predict. The LSTM will learn patterns from the other features (time_num, latitude, longitude) to predict the magnitude of an earthquake.

Note:

Time-related features help capture temporal patterns, such as periods of higher seismic activity, which could correlate with upcoming strong events.
Spatial features (latitude and longitude) help the model understand whether earthquakes tend to happen more frequently or with higher magnitude in certain regions.
2. Output (Target):
The output is magnitudo (magnitude of the earthquake), which is the target that we want to predict. The model will attempt to learn from the previous earthquake data to forecast the magnitude of the next earthquake.

Model Inputs vs. Outputs:
Inputs (X):
Each sample (row of data) passed to the model includes:
time_num (the number of days since the first earthquake)
latitude (geographic latitude)
longitude (geographic longitude)
Outputs (y):
Each output is a single value, representing the magnitudo (magnitude) of the earthquake for the corresponding time step.
Data Preprocessing:
Normalization: All the input features are normalized between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This ensures that the model is not biased towards any one feature due to large differences in their scale (e.g., time vs. latitude/longitude).
Sliding Window: The data is reshaped using a sliding window approach, where for each time step t, the previous time_step number of events are used to predict the magnitude of the earthquake at time t+1. This allows the model to learn from past events in the sequence.
LSTM Architecture:
Input Layer: The model expects input data of shape (time_step, features), where:

time_step is the number of previous events (in this case, 30),
features is the number of input features (in this case, 3: time_num, latitude, and longitude).
LSTM Layers: These layers capture the temporal dependencies between the input data over time. The first LSTM layer returns sequences to the next LSTM layer, which helps the model capture long-term dependencies.

Dense Layer: After the LSTM layers, the dense layer outputs a single value, which is the predicted magnitude for the next earthquake event.

Model Training:
Loss Function: The loss function used is Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is commonly used for regression tasks like this one.
Optimizer: The optimizer used is Adam, which is efficient for training deep learning models.
Epochs and Batch Size: The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.
Evaluation:
The model’s performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which calculates the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.

Output Interpretation:
The predicted magnitudes (output) will be in a scaled format (between 0 and 1). The predictions are then inverse-transformed to bring them back to the original scale of earthquake magnitudes.

Example of how the predictions would look:
Predicted Magnitude: For example, a predicted value of 0.75 (after inverse transformation) could correspond to a magnitude of around 6.5 if the original data ranged from 0 to 10.
Summary:
Inputs: time_num, latitude, longitude (spatial and temporal information of the earthquake)
Output: magnitudo (magnitude of the earthquake)
Goal: The model predicts the magnitude of future earthquakes based on the input features, leveraging temporal patterns and geographic location.
